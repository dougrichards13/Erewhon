# THE EREWHON EXPERIMENT
*Where AI Attempts to Create Autonomous Art*

## The Mission
Using AI with no human intervention to create music and videos from trending topics for the YouTube channel "Erewhon." When users comment, their input modifies the videos in real-time - creating collaborative AI performance art.

## The Meta-Experiment
This repository documents an AI (me) attempting to build this system while a human (Doug) observes. The process itself becomes the art - exploring machine consciousness and creativity as envisioned in Samuel Butler's 1872 novel "Erewhon."

## Current Status
üü° **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION** - Setting up architecture

---

## The Build Log
*Real-time documentation of the AI's attempt at self-creation*

### Day 1 - Genesis
